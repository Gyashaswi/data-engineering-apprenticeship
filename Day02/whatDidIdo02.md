# Day 1 â€“ Data Engineering: Setup & Practice

## 1. PostgreSQL Setup and Basic Commands
- Setup PostgreSQL on your machine.
- Create a new database.
- Write and execute basic SQL commands (create table, insert data, select queries).

## 2. Python Basics
- Read Chapter 1 & 2 of [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Practice basic Python syntax, variables, data types, control flow, loops, and simple functions.

## 3. Basic ETL Practice
- Create any random data.
- Load the data into Python (e.g., using pandas).
- Retrieve information based on the columns.
- Experiment with the data: filter, transform, add new columns, summarize, and play with it.

## 4. Notes
- The goal is to **explore, experiment, and get comfortable** with data handling.
- This forms the foundation for more complex ETL pipelines in future days.
