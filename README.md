Starting the Journey of data engineering from Zero to Pro

why do I want to learn Data engineering?
As a part of being in the exponentially data growing world data engineering seems very important to me.
For a beginner like me who wants to more knowledge on ETL and data pipelining for multiple data extraction, 
and creating smooth flow of data we need data pipelines,
and for efficient querying retriving and knowing the cloud platforms and working with them is very important.
So i start my journey here to become a Data Engineer from scratch.

what excites or intimidates me most?
Learning new skills always excites me most if that skill is related to data I love it the most
For now having so many things intimidates me but I'm sure I will learn them one by one step by step and make it easy 

what tools i already know?
I know Python, SQL from previous works(academic projects and internship) and I used pyspark but it was long ago nothing much.
Now I think I will learn and update them as per the joorney requirements.
